## [Today for Kids][weathosaurus]

An application to help kids learn about time and the weather.

### Problem

I have a 4 year old who always asks what we are doing today and what it's like outside. I wanted to create a small web app to help her visualize what we are doing with our schedule and what the weather is.

It needs to be a web app available on my smartphone first thing in the morning. It needs to have access to my location and a way of storing a simple schedule.

### Action

I've decided to the build a React application using MaterialUI. The persistence layer will be built using localStorage as there isn't very much to store, and no central repo of data should be necessary. I will need to reach out to a weather api and figure how to simplify the information down to a kid friendly interface.

### Result

I'm still resulting. Check back soon.
